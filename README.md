# CELL_MODEL

This is a repo for the CELL_MODEL project. 

TODO: 

Proper Python package code:
- Gromacs_Run class, generalize simulation setup independent of folder structure
- Add multiple CELL parsing in the code. 
- LAMMPS parser, figure out force field definitions in Martini --> use Moltemplate to prepare random Martini system. Or is Ksenia going to take care of this?

Project tools:

- Create PACKMOL wrapper for building ordered systems of multiple cells, and random systems of multiple cells
- Add on to tools in "cell_layer.py"
- Create sanity checks for simulations (msd analysis, tracking energy over simulations). Discuss with Shreyas
- Expand on GitHub by saving project progress here, also so other people can access them.
