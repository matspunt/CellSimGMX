This folder contains some useful tools for working with, and setting up simulations. 

- Functions that can parse .mdp settings and modify them through Python. For instance, integrator, timestep, nsteps, thermostat, coupling constant. 
- Functions that can modify an .itp file to change the masses on the fly. Initially, this only needs to work for only a single bead type. 

TODO: 

- Functions that can rerun the trajectories and extract the different components of the LJ interactions. 
- MSD trajectory analysis, sanity checks (discuss with Shreyas)
- I also want to add multiple CELL systems in these tools, currently they only work with one CELL.
